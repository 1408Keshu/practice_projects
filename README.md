Welcome to the `practice_projects` repository! 🎉

## About This Repo

This repository is a collection of various projects that I work on for different purposes:

- **Teaching Projects**: Projects that I use to teach during live classes.
- **Helping Friends**: Projects that I create to help my friends understand concepts better.
- **Learning & Fun**: Projects that I build just for fun or to learn something new.
